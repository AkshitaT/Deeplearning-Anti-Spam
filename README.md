# Deeplearning-Anti-Spam

The following repository provides the implementation of three deep learning algorithms for classification of the emails between spam and non-spam. The algorithms implemented are:

1. Dense Layer MLP
2. Stacked Denoising Autoencoder
3. Deep Belief Network

The above algorithms are implemented in Deeplearning4j (http://deeplearning4j.org).
